# ACAI-YOLOv8

## Abstract

This project addresses the challenge of identifying military aircraft from aerial images using computer vision (CV) techniques. For this project, we created a dataset of labeled aircraft using RoboFlow to demonstrate the capabilities of our models to learn and recognize different vehicles. We then applied data augmentation techniques to increase the effectiveness of our dataset and models.

The study explores the performance of three different CV models—YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and a custom deep learning implementation (ConvNet) built using PyTorch. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, designed and documented by Ultralytics, were implemented as baseline models for comparison. Our custom model was designed to address shortcomings observed in the baseline models, focusing on balancing computational efficiency and detection accuracy. By evaluating these models, we identified performance trade-offs and gained valuable insights into optimizing CV models for accurate aircraft detection in realistic datasets.

## Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics can be found in the "runs\detect\train." folder after the code has been run. This will include the following:

- **Confusion Matricies**
- **Precision-Confidence Curves**
- **Recall-Confidence Curves**
- **Precision-Recall Curves**
- **F1-Confidence Curves**

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages: Listed in `requirements.txt` within each model submodule
- CUDA-enabled GPU (recommended)

### **Commands**

Run the following command to install required libraries:

```bash
    pip install ultralytics
```

Run the following command to get the test results from the report:

```bash
    yolo detect train data=data.yaml model=yolov8s.pt epochs=30 imgsz=640 batch=16 device=0
```

Note: If running on a non-CUDA enabled device, run the following command instead:

```bash
    yolo detect train data=data.yaml model=yolov8s.pt epochs=30 imgsz=640 batch=16 device=cpu
```
